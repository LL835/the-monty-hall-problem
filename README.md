# Coding Challenge: The Monty Hall Problem
## Overview

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that goes like so:

>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The puzzle was famously featured in an American magazine in which columnist Marilyn vos Savant stated that switching doors is the better choice. She explained that the probability of picking the car when switching is 2/3. By contrast, the probability of picking the car when not switching is only 1/3.

This program aims to prove that vos Savant is correct by running sample games and comparing the success rate of the "switch" strategy against the "stick" strategy.
